# Companions Dialogue Bundle

Want to tell Aela that you couldn't make it to the Giant in time? Maybe you don't want to rely on quest markers to find Kodlak in order to join the Companions? Or perhaps you want to just have a more options when talking to the Companions in general. Look no further, Companions Dialogue Bundle is here to help!

## Features

- Fully voiced dialogue, using a mix of ElevenLabs AI, vanilla dialogue and spliced edits.
- Adds new dialogue options to the main questline of the Companions.
- Adds new misc dialogue to various Companion members.

It won't drastically change the way you play the game or add any overwhelming features, but hopefully it can enhance your roleplay experience, and make it feel a little fresh again.

## Other

Please feel free to check out my other mods as well. I'm working on more improvments to the Companions, so stay tuned.
