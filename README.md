# Companions Restoration Project - Companions Dialogue Bundle

The first part of the Companions Restoration Project is the Companions Dialogue Bundle. This mod adds a 100-something lines of new (voiced) dialogue to the Companions. It comes in new dialogue options, new misc dialogue for when you join the Companions and for when you are the Harbinger. I've kept a strong focus on keeping it as vanilla+ as possible and to not stray too far from the personalities of the Companions.

## Features

- Fully voiced dialogue, using a mix of ElevenLabs AI, vanilla dialogue and spliced edits.
- Adds new dialogue options to the main questline of the Companions.
	- Tell Aela you couldn't make it to the Giant in time if it's dead.
	- Tell Aela you already know who the Companions are.
	- Ask the Circle members where you can find Kodlak. (So you don't have to rely on the quest marker constantly)
	- Ask Skjor if he has any awesome stories from the Great War. (There are 3 possible to hear, and will trigger in different stages of the questline)
	- Ask Skjor if he has any advice for you. (There are 6 possible to hear and will give a small buff for a short period of time)
	- Throughout the main questline you will find some new dialogue options.
	- Adds a funeral scene for Skjor.
- Adds new misc dialogue to various Companion members.
	- All the minor Companions (Njada, Ria, Athis & Torvar) will have new lines of misc dialogue so you don't have to hear the same 2-3 lines over and over again.
	- All the Circle members (Aela, Farkas, Vilkas & Skjor) will have a few lines of misc dialogue added as well.

It won't drastically change the way you play the game or add any overwhelming features, but hopefully it can enhance your roleplay experience, and make it feel a little fresh again. And especially breathe some new life into the Companions.

## What is the Companions Restoration Project?

The Companions is my favorite faction despite its flaws. It's the first one you encounter, and as someone who prefers the Warrior stereotype, they fit my playstyle very well. I don't, however, like that it feels rushed and unfinished. The Companions Restoration Project aims to fix some of this without straying too far from the vanilla game. It's not a complete overhaul (because the Companions is messy as hell), instead it aims to add or tweak things to make it feel more complete. 

This is just the first part of the mod, look forward to more in this series in the future.
