# Companions Dialogue Bundle

This mod adds a 100-something lines of new (voiced) dialogue to the Companions. It comes in new dialogue options, new misc dialogue for when you join the Companions and for when you are the Harbinger. I've kept a strong focus on keeping it as vanilla+ as possible and to not stray too far from the personalities of the Companions.

## Features

- Fully voiced dialogue, using a mix of ElevenLabs AI, vanilla dialogue and spliced edits.
- Adds new dialogue options to the main questline of the Companions.
	- Tell Aela you couldn't make it to the Giant in time if it's dead.
	- Tell Aela you already know who the Companions are (Skips the "An outsider, eh?" dialogue)
	- Ask the Circle members where you can find Kodlak. (So you don't have to rely on the quest marker constantly)
	- Ask Skjor if he has any awesome stories from the Great War.
	- Ask Skjor if he has any advice for you.
		- There are 6 possible to hear and will give a small buff for a short period of time
- Adds new scenes between Companions
	- Aela & Ria will have a scene where Ria asks to join Aela on a hunt.
	- Farkas & Vilkas will have a brotherly scene about taking care of weapons.
	- Ria & Torvar will have a scene where Torvar asks Ria out.
- Adds new misc dialogue to various Companion members.
	- Njada will have more misc dialogue with her usual attitude.
	- Ria will have more random dialogue to counter the two repetitive lines she has.
	- Torvar will have some new dialogue about mead and fighting.
	- Athius will have some new dialogue.
	- Vilkas, Farkas & Aela have some new misc dialogue, but not as much as the minor Companions do.
- While not dialogue related, this mod fixes the issue where the Companion who has given you a quest just stands by the door. This mod fixes that so that scenes can play out more organically.

It won't drastically change the way you play the game or add any overwhelming features, but hopefully it can enhance your roleplay experience, and make it feel a little fresh again. And especially breathe some new life into the Companions.
