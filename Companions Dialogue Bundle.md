# Companions Dialogue Bundle

### "Well that's taken care of, no thanks to you"

- It was already dead before I got here
  - Ah.. my mistake
  - I guess so. I'm sorry
- You killed it before I had a chance to help
  - I guess so...
  - You're right, sorry.

### "You handle yourself well, you could make for a decent shield-[brother/sister]"

- So you are Companions?
  - We are. If you think you got what it takes, come to Jorrvaskr.

When you ask the Circle members if you can join, they will all point you towards Kodlak. However, they won't tell you where Kodlak is. Now there will be a question for you to ask where you can find Kodlak instead.

- Where can I find Kodlak?
  - He's probably in his quarters in Jorrvaskr. Just head downstairs and you'll find his room at the end of the hall. (Skjor)
  - How should I know? He's most likely in Jorrvaskr, in his quarters. (Farkas)
  - Kodlak? You'll most likely find him in his quarters in Jorrvaskr. (Aela)


## Misc Dialogue

### Njada

- Keep your distance, unless you want to taste the sharp end of my blade
- Go bother someone else.
- Don't mistake my bluntness for rudeness. I simply don't have time to coddle the fragile egos of others.
- The world outside is harsh and unforgiving. If you want to survive, toughen up and stop expecting handouts.

When the player is Harbinger:

- What do you need? I'm at your service.
- I may not say it often, but your skill and dedication inspire us all

### Athis

- A well-placed strike from a small blade can be just as lethal as any big weapon.
- They say the bigger they are, the harder they fall. Well, I say the smaller the blade, the faster they bleed.
- I walk with the spirits of my ancestors, guiding my every step.
- Sorry, can't talk right now.
- Don't you have something more important to do?

When the player is Harbinger:

- I've seen you in action. I can't deny your expertise.
- You've earned your place as the Harbinger, and I won't deny your accomplishments
- You've got the skills to back up your title. Just don't let it go to your head.
- Just remember, respect is earned, not given.

### Torvar

- The mead flows freely, my friend! Just don't expect me to hold my liquor as well as I hold a battleaxe.
- Don't let my drunken demeanor fool you. When it's time to raise arms, I'm as focused as a bear on the hunt.
- Give me a brawl and a mug of ale any day, and I'm a happy warrior.

When the player is Harbinger:

- Being Harbinger means you've got the weight of the pack on your shoulders. I don't envy you.
- Keep leading, and I'll keep swinging my axe for you.
- How about celebrating our victories with a drink? My treat, of course.

### Ria

- Training hard keeps me sharp. Can't afford to slack off.
- The thrill of battle is like nothing else. It gets my blood pumping.
- Jorrvaskr really feels like home now.
- Have you seen Skjor around? I want to ask him about the Great War.
- Aela's an impressive warrior. I hope to be as skilled as her one day.
- Kodlak's wisdom is unmatched. I'm grateful for his guidance.
- The people of Whiterun look up to the Companions. It's a responsibility we take seriously.
- Vilkas may seem rough around the edges, but deep down, he's loyal to the core.
- Hammers and blades, that's what we do best. But there's more to life than just fighting.

For when the player is Harbinger:

- Do you have any guidance for me, Harbinger?
- I may not always see eye to eye with you, but I respect your position, Harbinger.
- I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I miss Kodlak.

### Vilkas

- You know, knowledge is a weapon in itself.
- A well-prepared warrior is a formidable one.
- Stay vigilant, danger lurks in every corner.
- Learn from your defeats. Every battle, every loss holds a lesson.
- I know I'm no Skjor, but I'm by your side if you need me, Harbinger.

### Farkas

- A true warrior knows when to fight and when to show mercy.
- Do you think Kodlak is arm-wrestling Ysgramor right now?
- We fight as a pack, and our strength lies in our unity.
- I've been thinking much clearer since Ysgramor's Tomb. (play after cleansing Farkas)

### Aela

- When I'm out there, tracking prey and feeling the wind on my face, I know I'm where I'm meant to be.
- The moon's light guides our path. There's a certain power that comes with embracing our inner beasts.
- Patience and perseverance are the keys to a successful hunt.

### Skjor

Skjor is one of the most under-utilized characters in the Companions. Probably because he dies fairly early.
The thing is, it's hard to care about his death because you never really get to know him. And after his death no one really mentions him. 
This mods adds some new dialogue that you can unlock as you progress through the Companions questline.

#### **Misc Dialogue**

- What do you want? Make it quick.
- Spare me the idle chatter, we have business to attend to.

#### **Any advice?**

You can now ask Skjor for some advice as you journey through the Companions questline. There are 6 different pieces of advice, and they will each grant a small little buff to you for a short period of time.

Buff granted:

**Inspired** - 10% increased skill gain in all Warrior skills for 6 hour

- Courage is not the absence of fear, but the will to face it head-on. Embrace your fears, and they will become your allies. (Courage)
- In battle, focus on your instincts and let them guide you. Trust yourself. (Focus)
- Learn from your failures, for they are the stepping stones to greatness. (Introspection)
- The path of a warrior is filled with challenges, but with each trial, you grow stronger. Embrace the journey. (Perseverance)
- The Companions are bound by honor and loyalty. Protect those in need, and they will find strength in your presence. (Strength)
- Remember, a leader leads by example, not just with words. Show your comrades the way with unwavering resolve. (Leadership)

Once all advice has been exhausted, Skjor will say:

- "I got no more advice for you, whelp. Seek your own path now."

The player can respond with:

- "Thank you for your guidance. I'll keep your advice in mind."
	- Skjor: "You've grown. Remember, the true strength lies within you. Forge your own destiny with the wisdom you've gained"
- "Is that all? I was hoping for more."
	- Skjor: "You've got fire in your words, but remember, true strength is earned, not entitled. Find your own path, prove your worth, and perhaps then you'll understand."

Grateful response effect: "Skjor's Wisdom"
	- Blessed with Skjor's wisdom, your abilities are enhanced, granting you a heightened sense of purpose and increased proficiency in your chosen skills.
Entitled response effect: "Skjor's Challenge"
	- In response to your entitled attitude, Skjor presents you with a challenge. Your journey ahead will be more arduous, but through perseverance, you have the potential to prove yourself and unlock hidden reserves of strength.


#### **War Stories**

Skjor fought in the Great War, so naturally he has some stories to tell. A new line by Ria even mentions about the stories a bit. Now you can ask him about his stories. These are inspired by Canderous war stories from Knights of the Old Republic, but of course more linear and shorter. If you like them, I might add more stories like this to other companions.

- A victory forged in fire.
- In the face of overwhelming odds.
- The indomitable spirit of warriors.

## New Scenes

### Vilkas & Farkas

You may encounter a new scene between Vilkas & Farkas where they talk about sharpening blades.

Vilkas: Your blade looks a bit dull. When was the last time you sharpened it?
Farkas: You know me, I get caught up in the heat of battle, and the maintenance stuff slips my mind.
Vilkas: Always forgetting the little things. A warrior's weapon should be an extension of themselves, sharp and ready.
Farkas: And that's why I have you, brother. The meticulous one who keeps everything in order.
Vilkas: Take care of your own weapon, Farkas. It's a vital skill for any warrior. You do remember how to sharpen a blade, right?
Farkas: Of course I do...
Vilkas: Meet me in the training yard. I'll show you how it's done.

### Ria & Torvar

You may encounter a new scene where Torvar hits on Ria, but fails.

Torvar: "You know, you're one fierce warrior. I can't help but be attracted to a woman who can swing a sword like you."
Ria: "Thanks, Torvar. I appreciate the compliment. But you know I value our friendship, and I'm not looking for anything more than that."
Torvar: "Ah, come on, Ria. Let's have some fun. You never know what could happen between us."
Ria: "Torvar, you're a great guy and a skilled fighter. But right now, I think it's the mead talking. Let's enjoy the night as friends, okay?"
Torvar: "Alright, Ria. Friends it is."

### Ria & Aela

You may encounter a new scene between Ria & Aela.

Ria: "Mind if I join you on your hunt? I've been practicing my archery skills, and I could use some guidance from someone like you."
Aela: "You want to come hunting with me? It takes more than just shooting arrows, you know."
Ria: "I know, Aela. I've been studying your techniques, and I can't wait to put them into practice. Plus, spending time together would be nice."
Aela: "Alright, I'll give you a chance. But remember, hunting is about survival and respect for nature."
Ria: "So see you tomorrow morning then?"

### Ria & Njada

You may encounter a new scene between Ria & Njada.

Ria: "Any pointers on my sword and shield technique?"
Njada: "Seriously Ria? You swing that sword like a blind mammoth. Try moving your feet for once."
Ria: "Alright, no need to be so snarky"
Njada: "Just stating the obvious. Keep practicing, maybe you'll catch up someday"

### Athis & Njada

You may encounter a new scene between Athis & Njada.

Athis: "Don't think I'm impressed just because you won that stupid fist fight"
Njada: "Oh, look who's bitter. Can't handle losing?"
Athis: "Oh shut it. It was a fluke and you know it"
Njada: "Fluke or not, I still came out on top. Deal with it, loser"
Athis: "You won't have the upper hand forever. I'll make sure of it."

### Skjor & Vilkas

You may encounter a new scene between Skjor & Vilkas.

Skjor: "You've got a spring in your step today. Got someone on your mind, do you?"
Vilkas: "Oh come on, Skjor. Can't I just enjoy the day without your teasing?"
Skjor: "Teasing? Me? Never. But I've seen that look before, my friend. Don't deny it!"
Vilkas: "Fine, you caught me. There might be someone who caught my eye, but that is all there is to it."
Skjor: "Vilkas, you sly dog. Keep me updated, alright? I want all the gossip."

### Aela & Farkas

You may encounter a new scene between Aela & Farkas.

Aela: "Farkas, you ever think about what we'd do if we weren't Companions?"
Farkas: "My mind can barely fathom a life without battling beasts and sharing mead with you lot."
Aela: "Hah, you're right. I can't picture us doing anything else but hunting and causing mayhem."
Farkas: "Maybe we could open a tavern someday? Where the mead flows and the bards sing of our epic battles."
Aela: "I like the way you think, Farkas. A place where warriors can unwind and share their tales. Count me in!"

## Quest Related Dialogue

In order to make the Companions feel more alive and reactive to what happens in the questline, but also generally in the world, I've added more dialogue & scenes to the Companions.

### After Take Up Arms

You may encounter a new scene between Skjor & Vignar.

Vignar: I saw Vilkas training with the new blood.
Skjor: Yes, a promising recruit. And right after we took in Ria too.
Vignar: It's good to see the Companions growing. I was worried we'd become too complacent.
Skjor: Don't worry, Vignar. We'll keep the old traditions alive. And we'll make sure the new blood does too.
Vignar: I trust you, Skjor.

### After Proving Honor

Njada:
- So they're really let you in, huh? I guess we'll see if you're worth it.
- Since you're a Companion now, I guess I'll have to tolerate you.
- If you need any training with a shield, let me know. I'll show you how it's done.

Athis:
- I can't believe they let you in. I guess we'll see if you can handle yourself.
- Just because you're a Companion now, doesn't mean I'll go easy on you.

Torvar:
- Ah, welcome to the Companions. I'm sure you'll fit right in.

Ria:
- I'm glad you're a Companion now. I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun together.
- You made it through the trial? Congratulations.
- I wish my trial was as exciting as yours.

### After The Silver Hand

You may encounter a new scene between Aela & Njada:

Njada: I can't believe Skjor is gone.
Aela: I know, it doesn't feel real. I keep expecting him to walk through the door.
Njada: At least he died fighting. He wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
Aela: That's true. He was a true warrior, and a true Companion.
Njada: And a true Shield-Brother. We'll never forget him.
Aela: Never, shield-sister.
