# Companions Dialogue Bundle

### "Well that's taken care of, no thanks to you"

- It was already dead before I got here
  - Ah.. my mistake
  - I guess so. I'm sorry
- You killed it before I had a chance to help
  - I guess so...
  - You're right, sorry.

### "You handle yourself well, you could make for a decent shield-[brother/sister]"

- So you are Companions?
  - We are. If you think you got what it takes, come to Jorrvaskr.


## Misc Dialogue

If you haven't joined the Companions, you can ask any member of the Circle if you can join. They'll tell you to talk to Kodlak, but not where to find him as you have to rely on quest markers for this. One new line has been added to ask where Kodlak can be found.

- Where can I find Kodlak?
  - He's probably in his quarters in Jorrvaskr. Just head downstairs and you'll find his room at the end of the hall. (Skjor)
  - How should I know? He's most likely in Jorrvaskr, in his quarters. (Farkas)
  - Kodlak? You'll most likely find him in his quarters in Jorrvaskr. (Aela)

Before witnessing your shield-sibling turn into a werewolf, you can now ask Skjor about being a werewolf, but you must've joined the Companions.

- Is it true that you're a werewolf?
  - I don't know who you've been talking to, but they were clearly mistaken. Especially for a new whelp, you should choose your words more carefully.

After having witnessed the transformation from Farkas, you can ask Skjor about being a werewolf.

- Are all Circle members werewolves?
  - The old man and I have our differences when it comes to this. It's a blessing, given by Hircine. To worry about the hereafter means losing sight of the now. What do I care about Sovngarde? Give me the power to tear my foes as a beast of the wild, and I will savor it.

## Proving Honor

When talking to Skjor to trigger the quest, in vanilla you get two options ("What does this have to do with me", or "I'd be honored to retrieve it"). Now you have a few more options:

- Isn't there someone better suited for this task? (go to "What does this have to do with me" response)
- Go on, I'm listening (go to "What does this have to do with me" response)
- So, you want me to retrieve it? (go to "What does this have to do with me" response)
- This sounds like a setup
  - It might be, but the honor of the Companions demands that we seek it out. (go back to choices)
