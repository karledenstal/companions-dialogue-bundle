# Companions Dialogue Bundle

### "Well that's taken care of, no thanks to you"

- It was already dead before I got here
  - Ah.. my mistake
  - I guess so. I'm sorry
- You killed it before I had a chance to help
  - I guess so...
  - You're right, sorry.

### "You handle yourself well, you could make for a decent shield-[brother/sister]"

- So you are Companions?
  - We are. If you think you got what it takes, come to Jorrvaskr.

When you ask the Circle members if you can join, they will all point you towards Kodlak. However, they won't tell you where Kodlak is. Now there will be a question for you to ask where you can find Kodlak instead.

- Where can I find Kodlak?
  - He's probably in his quarters in Jorrvaskr. Just head downstairs and you'll find his room at the end of the hall. (Skjor)
  - How should I know? He's most likely in Jorrvaskr, in his quarters. (Farkas)
  - Kodlak? You'll most likely find him in his quarters in Jorrvaskr. (Aela)
